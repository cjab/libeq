/// This fragment describes how a skeleton piece is shifted or rotated relative to its parent
/// piece. The overall skeleton is contained in a 0x10 Skeleton Track Set fragment and is
/// structured as a hierarchical tree (see that fragment for information on how skeletons
/// are structured). The 0x12 fragment contains information on how that particular skeleton
/// piece is rotated and/or shifted relative to its parent piece.
///
/// Rotation and shifting information is contained as a series of fractions. The fragment
/// contains one denominator value for rotation and another for translation (X, Y, Z, shift).
/// It contains one numerator each for X, Y, Z rotation and shift, for a total of eight values.
/// For rotation, the resulting value should be multiplied by Pi / 2 radians (i.e. 1 corresponds
/// to 90 degrees, 2 corresponds to 180 degrees, etc.).

/// For rendering polygons, the X, Y, Z rotation and shift information in this fragment should
/// be taken into account by adding them to the rotation and shift values passed from the parent
/// piece (that is, rotation and shift are cumulative). However, before adding the shift values,
/// the X, Y, and Z shift values should first be rotated according to the parent’s rotation values.
/// The rotation values in this fragment represent the orientation of this piece relative to the
/// parent so calculating its starting position should not take its own rotation into account.
///

///   * Calculate the X, Y, and Z shift values from this fragment
///   * Rotate the shift values according to the rotation values from the parent piece
///   * Add the shift values to the shift values from the parent piece
///   * Calculate the X, Y, and Z rotation values from this fragment
///   * Add the rotation values to the rotation values from the parent piece
///   * Adjust the vertices for this piece by rotating them using the new rotation values and then
///     shifting them by the new shift values (or save the rotation and shift values for this piece
///     to be looked up later on when rendering)
///   * Process the next piece in the tree with the new rotation and shift values
///   * When all pieces have been processed, render all meshes in the model, using either the
///     adjusted vertex values (more efficient) or looking up the corresponding piece for each
///     vertex and adjusting the vertex values according to the adjusted rotation and shift values
